# AmazonPrice
Chrome extension that converts an item's total price to local currency. (Not yet)

* This was initially a personal project. So, it is **not ready for public use yet**.
* Currently uses fixer.io to get currency rates.
* Only converts to Turkish Liras (TRY) right now.
* Will look into porting to Firefox, Opera and maybe Edge.
